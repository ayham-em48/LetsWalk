			<h1>Is there a difference between losing weight and burning fat?</h1>
			<section>
				<p>Losing weight and burning fat are sometimes seen as two different goals but the steps needed to accomplish either
				are identical. At the core of both is calorie balance; the relationship between how many calories you burn and eat.
				During positive calorie balance, the body stores fat while a negative calorie balance forces the body to burn fat leading
				to weight loss. This calories in versus calories out relationship dictates whether the body stores fat causing weight gain
				or burns fat causing weight loss.</p>
				<h2>The Difference</h2>
				<p>Weight changes based on how many calories you eat relative to how much you burn. Weight loss happens when you burn more
				than you eat; a calorie deficit. A calorie deficit is the "magic" or "secret" making weight loss possible.<br><br>For example,
				if you burn 3,000 calories in a day and only eat 2,500, you've only given the body 2,500 calories when it needs 3,000. This
				forces the body to find those extra 500 calories from non-food sources. The 500 non-food calories make up the calorie deficit.
				Typically, non-food sources of energy come from either stored body fat or muscle tissue.<br><br>Inversely, if you burn 2,500
				calories and eat 3,000, you've given the body an extra 500 calories of energy; a <b>calorie surplus</b>. With exercise, part
				of this 500 calories is used to grow muscle tissue. The rest is stored as fat. Without exercise, all excess energy is stored as
				fat.<br><br>A calorie deficit always leads to weight loss while a calorie surplus always leads to weight gain. During a calorie
				surplus, the body stores extra energy. This extra, stored energy becomes non-food sources of calories during a deficit. In other
				words, a calorie deficit burns the energy stored during a calorie surplus.<br><br>When a calorie deficit forces the body to burn
				fat, all the disappearing fat causes weight loss and a decreasing body fat percentage. Weight loss and burning body fat are two
				ways of describing the same process.<br><br>During weight loss, it's ideal to lose as much body fat as possible without sacrificing
				any muscle. Unfortunately this is very hard if not impossible to do. Weight loss is achieved through a combination of fat and muscle
				loss. There are a few ways to keep weight loss from eating up too much muscle, but there is no way to completely avoid it.</p>
