			<h1>Is a gym necessary?</h1>
			<section>
				<p>A lot of people think that a gym is the best place to exercise. They have great equipment, staff that can show you
				new exercises and an environment that promotes fitness. Unfortunately, not everyone can afford a gym membership and
				others are not comfortable visiting one. So is the gym the only place you can get a good workout or can you get in
				shape another way?</p>
				<h2>Equipment</h2>
				<p>The truth is that a gym is a very good place to start if you want to get in shape. Most of the machines are hard
				if not impossible to get injured on, the free weights provide a good range of motion and the personal trainers can
				give you that extra motivation you need.</p>
				<h2>Gym-Free</h2>
				<p>There are however, other options you can use to get into shape. For starters, you can dust off that old bike that's
				sitting in the garage and start riding it. Biking is a low impact, pretty easy exercise that can help beginners increase
				their endurance. You can also start running, swimming and playing sports. For strength training, you can do push ups,
				pull ups, sit ups, body weight squats and lunges. You can also buy a few inexpensive and lightweight dumbbells from a
				sporting goods store.</p>
				<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
				<p>While the gym is definitely a nice amenity to have, it isn't necessary to get into shape. Don't let the fact that you
				can't go to a gym turn into an excuse for being unhealthy and lazy.</p>
