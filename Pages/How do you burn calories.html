			<h1>How do you burn calories?</h1>
			<section>
				<p>The basic answer: physical activity and exercise burns calories. There are many different types of exercise.
				Incorporating all of them into your daily routine will create a well rounded workout that will help you reach your
				fitness goals.</p>
				<h2>Weight Balance</h2>
				<p>Your weight is determined by the relationship between how many calories you eat and how many you burn. Eating
				more than you burn is known as a calorie surplus and leads to weight gain. Burning more than you eat is known as a
				calorie deficit and leads to weight loss. Regardless of your weight goals, exercise and burning calories are required
				to reach them.</p>
				<h2>Burning Calories</h2>
				<p>Your body is always burning energy, even when you are doing tasks that seem unrelated to exercise such as eating,
				reading and even sleeping. Your body burns energy to power your brain, digest food and keep your heart beating. In addition
				to keeping you alive, exercise and physical activity both make up a huge chunk of your daily energy expenditure. Exercise and
				physical activity are the only two ways you can significantly increase how many calories your body burns each day. You can
				estimate your daily energy needs by using the <b><a href="Calories.html">calorie calculator.</a></b></p>
				<h2>Types of Exercise & Physical Activity</h2>
				<p>There are different types of exercise you can use to burn calories, each having a slightly different effect on the body.
				The three main types of exercise are: strength training, cardiovascular and high intensity.</p>
				<h2>Strength Training</h2>
				<p>Strength training's main purpose is building muscle. Strength training includes lifting weights (free weights or machines)
				or using body weight exercises (push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups) to build muscle. Though strength training is not thought of as a
				calorie burning exercise, it should be used in conjunction with any weight loss strategy. Strength training can also increase
				bone density which can prevent osteoporosis.<br><br>Muscle is a very high maintenance tissue; it takes a lot of energy to keep
				it alive. You will burn more calories throughout the day (even at rest) by building more muscle. Take two scenarios: person A is
				160 pounds and has a body fat of 5%, person B is 160 pounds but has a body fat of 20%. Person A has a lot more muscle and therefore
				burns a lot more calories throughout the day, even when they are not exercising. This is because person B's fat tissue does not
				burn nearly as much energy as the muscle on person A. You can speed up your metabolism by building more muscle.</p>
